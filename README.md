# roundRobin
A Java-based Round Robin CPU simulator.

Entry is given through an "input.txt" file in the form of lines consisting of integers x,y,z.

x: represents process ID

y: arriving time of process to the CPU

z: necessary processing time

When there is no "input.txt" file to read, a random input is generated.

After running the code(or the equivalent .jar file in case we create it), output is stored in the automatically generated "output.txt".
